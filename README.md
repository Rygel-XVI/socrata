# Socrata

Application that takes in dimensions for a map and has you place two rovers on the map and then move them.

## Installation

Clone this github repo and bundle

Then execute:

    $ ruby bin/rover.rb


## Usage

  First choose two positive integers > 0 for the map coordinates and then two positive integers for the rover position on the map and a direction that it will be facing.
  You will do this twice for each rover and then it will return the ending coordinates of the rover.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
